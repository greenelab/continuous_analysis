# Continuous Analysis

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

This repository presents [Continuous Analysis](http://greenelab.github.io/continuous_analysis/), a process demonstrating computational reproducibility by producing verifiable end-to-end runs of computational research. The process is described in detail in: [Nature Biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3780) and [Biorxiv Preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/056473).

We encourage additions and improvements, please create an issue or better yet, implement it and create a pull request. Please let us know if you run into any difficulty implementing continuous analysis on your own.

## Examples

Examples and real applications of continuous analysis are available:

* RNA-seq Analysis:
	* Using [Salmon](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/continuous_analysis_rnaseq) (and Drone v0.5)
	* Using [Kallisto](https://github.com/greenelab/continuous_analysis_rnaseq)
* [Phylogenetic Tree Building](https://github.com/greenelab/continuous_analysis_phylo)
* [Microarray Differential Expression Analysis](https://github.com/greenelab/continuous_analysis_brainarray) - example from Continuous Analysis Paper
* [EHR Imputation](https://github.com/epistasislab/imputation)
* [Privacy-preserving generative deep neural networks support clinical data sharing](https://github.com/greenelab/SPRINT_gan)
* [Denoising Autoencoders for Phenotype Stratification](https://github.com/greenelab/DAPS)

This repository shows example configurations with a locally hosted [Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone) installation as well as [Shippable](https://app.shippable.com/), [wercker](http://wercker.com/) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). It uses a small test run of [Kallisto](https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto) as an example. The figures below are re-generated with each commit.
